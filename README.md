# PyColors UI

**Documentation-first UI system for SaaS & AI products.**

PyColors UI is a production-oriented design system focused on helping teams
ship consistent interfaces faster — without sacrificing clarity or scalability.

---

## What it is

- **Radix-based UI primitives** with stable APIs
- **Semantic token system** for scalable theming
- **Documentation-first approach**  
  Preview → Usage → Code → Props
- Designed for **real SaaS products**, not demo kits

---

## What ships today (v1.x)

- Button, Input, Badge, Card, Alert
- Predictable variants, sizing, and interaction states
- Complete documentation baseline
- Public roadmap and changelog

---

## Direction

PyColors UI evolves in clear stages:

1. **UI primitives** (stable, documented)
2. **Blocks & patterns** (marketing + SaaS)
3. **Commercial templates** built on the same system

Early templates may ship ahead of full UI migration,
with a clear upgrade path.
